Phaedra finding animals to keep as pets it adorable. The frog in a pink cape was absolutely adorable!;6434;18;17;101;Very Positive;2024
Phaedra is so COOL. The way she kept her composure throughout the challenge and held it together mentally was incredible, even when TJ attempted to break her cool by bringing up her kid (which her response to was absolutely appropriate, and actually rather graceful considering the situation). She didn't talk herself up more than she was capable of acting on (unlike, ahem, the ENTIRE boys team minus Josh).;2837;69;55;408;Very Positive;2024
24:01 The fact that Pedra let him have the wipes was both wise and heartwarming. Even after he attacked her with words, she was kind enough to let him have them, thus earning the second paper wipes. Additionally, the denial of his private chef wish at the end was well thought out—not based on a 'he agreed, so I should too' mentality. Big respect to Pedra.;3497;68;55;357;Positive;2024
Phaedra is the person i want to grow up as. Her determination and mental strength was INSANE;304;17;17;92;Very Positive;2024
I really love the Phaedra's determination and attitude. She's really awesome in all aspect.;8484;16;14;91;Very Positive;2024
Bro i respect the girl, she didn't try to be bold but stay silent and calm that's a smart way to win a conversation;45532;26;24;115;Positive;2024

Phaedra is a total class act! Love her!  Her frog buddy was sooo adorable too jaha;111;16;15;82;Very Positive;2024
Phedra is genuinely the best person you’ve ever had in a video. Her heart is so kind;11006;18;17;84;Very Positive;2024
I think this was my favorite of your videos, I am literally still crying from how beautiful the bond was between the girls team. They worked together, were tactful, respectful and smart, they were all supportive and thinking of their team members not getting caught up in petty matters. I absolutely loved this video, inspired me, now I wanna go have some time in the woods with some girlfriends!;907;69;55;396;Very Positive;2024
"i think it’s really cool to observe how and why the two teams participated differently.

the girls immediately bonded, shared the same interests, and were willing to recognise that some of them were better survivors, and trusted them for the entire challenge. phaedra stepping up as the leader and allowing herself to stay alone for over a month is just so strong. 

the boys on the other hand, had that one negative cog in the machine (Patrick) who influenced them to such an extent that there was a wedge in the whole team. they had no teamwork, no efficiency, and just winged it on pure willpower. josh was the most consistent guy on their team, but he got singled out and quickly they lost their best chance.

I also think it’s really cool that despite existence of frats and brotherhoods, the “girls girl” concept is so impactful especially nowadays that it brought them all together. 

even more than food, the real importance was in teamwork and the women were outstanding in that field.";78152;175;115;994;Positive;2024
The girls were the exact definition of work smarter, not harder. ;68;11;10;65;Neutral;2024
Man, I gotta respect her. She didn’t try to act tough, just stayed quiet and calm—such a smart way to win a conversation.;4337;25;23;121;Very Positive;2024
At first, I thought the women's team was letting the team out too quickly, but when I saw the ending, I realized the choice was wise. Amazing;924;28;21;141;Very Positive;2024
23:33 She has so much self control. He kept saying negative things about her and even talked about her son to make her miss him when she was polite and sweet to him. You can tell she is an amazing mother just by how she handled that. Jesus loves you ;1255;51;41;250;Very Positive;2024

Congratulations 2 the women on what i thought was a better strategy from the start.  As a man i was hoping they would win. Phaedra lasting  that long alone was incredible !. We will get them next time boys .;212;38;33;207;Very Positive;2024
Phedra kept her promise and was determined. Tbh I won't survive that long. Kudos to her and her teams strategic moves;776;22;19;117;Positive;2024

This makes so much more sense! I was annoyed that chandlers wasn’t in the cave video but it was because he was doing another video!;28218;26;23;131;Very Positive;2024
"Awesome video.
I actually supported the girls, they approached the competition with an awesome strategy, I was rooting for them";16;20;17;127;Very Positive;2024
"Fun fact: At day 60 ( challenge 6 ) 6:20 , one of them could've asked for another 500k for his team , the other asking for anything , both of them agree, and after that the one who got 500k for his team leave , and the others win the original 500k 
A W-W situation ( just a opinion  ;) )";6316;56;39;287;Positive;2024
The reaction that Phaedra had when she saw her teammates is the beauty of friendship.;433;15;14;85;Positive;2024
Phaedra is one of the most amazing player mr beast had in his challenges for real. You're so brave and humble. Stay wonderful ;1680;24;24;126;Very Positive;2024

I hope the women stay friends. She really stood for 60 days that’s insane ;84;15;15;74;Very Negative;2024
Phaedra was sweet and respectful. She even looked like a protogonist of a survival game lol. She deserved to win!;311;20;18;113;Very Positive;2024

15:55 is crazy that Patrick is being really selfish for a lot of reason considering he lost the first challenge for being extremely confident;384;25;22;141;Neutral;2024
I think Phaedra should get a bigger share of the money. I mean... Phaedra is the one who is willing to survive in the forest. Keeping sane is not easy.;2265;30;24;151;Neutral;2024

man i really teared up at the end when the girls were all together again! the women were so inspirational!!! Phaedra was AMAZING!!!! she deserved something extra for absolutely killing it!!!;726;31;28;190;Very Positive;2024
TJ carried. The only reason he quit was because he was literally out of rations. I'm seeing people clowning on him for crying, but the poor dude gave it his all.;173;32;29;161;Very Negative;2024

the guy  wanted the tent , did not care if the other guy left  . But phaedra wanted julia to stay because they could be together . but the opposite happened . im so proud of the girls humble, smart  kind yet determined with a sense of unity ;852;44;36;241;Very Positive;2024

Honestly the 2nd last lady made a huge mistake leaving the last one behind isolation in this challenge would be brutal;133;21;19;118;Very Negative;2024
NAHH PATRICKS SWITCHUP IS CRAZY  man was humbled so fast by a wild bear 21:00;4243;16;16;77;Very Negative;2024
Man the girls were heavily favoured. Boys had too many slackers and one who ruined everything while the girls had 2 survivalists. I feel bad for the final boy. He carried the team and props for the final girl for holding strong for 40 days;4629;45;34;239;Negative;2024
Why was bro allowed to spy on them? That’s ridiculous;6;11;11;53;Very Negative;2024

Главное стратегия и командный дух парни съели свои припасы ,а потом слились и это только ухудшило положение последнего из команды. Девушки придерживались изначально стратегии и она привела их к победе уважение последней участнице.;1;33;31;230;Positive;2024
I teared up at the end. The women strategy really worked am glad;674;13;12;64;Positive;2024
I didn't understand the girl going for the tent and leaving Pheodra alone. It was a bad choice. Patrick, on the other hand, might be the main reason the boys lost.;1910;32;28;163;Negative;2024

The beginning really shows how important it is to have a sense of a group supporting each other. Just having a bad apple really does spoil the bunch. TJ actually did an amazing job for going that far. And of course, props goes to the women's team for the win.;2276;51;42;259;Positive;2024

Funny thing is the guy who chose to keep himself in the game and turn down the tent was the last guy standing and he didn’t have a tent…but I guess also if he would have sacrificed himself the bear still would have made the other guy leave so so the boys would have just lost anyway;59;59;41;282;Positive;2024

Patrick is literally the one who made team man losing this challenge. He is just having a blast like in some party or some sort and not thinking how to survive. And even said Josh did nothing, i can't believe it. They should just let Josh and TJ win the challenge for them;714;54;46;272;Very Negative;2024
