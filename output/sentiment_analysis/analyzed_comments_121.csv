"Obviously as I stated in the video multiple times don’t try this at home without medical supervision like I had. 

Also for more context, I have Crohn’s disease (basically my gut has tons of inflammation) and I wanted to give it a break from food to see if that would help reduce inflammation because Crohn’s sucks. I learned a lot about how I can use fasting to reduce my inflammation and I’m glad I did this challenge :)";239206;81;63;422;Very Positive

Crohn's is no joke... People don't talk about serious GI disorders enough.  I have Gastroparesis and my stomach totally shut down once-- I had to be 'fed' through a central IV line for a couple months.  It was an absolute nightmare... But this makes me wish I'd documented the experience more.  What a unique way to spread awareness. Wishing you healing and recovery ;817;66;60;367;Very Negative
To be fair if there was any reason to break a fast, a hand-cooked meal from Gordon-freakin’-Ramsey is probably one of the best and most understandable reasons out there.;6821;32;29;169;Neutral

I've only been diagnosed with Crohn's for about 2 years now, been up and really down, especially because I can't have most medications we've tried. When I read online that you have it too, it gave me a lot of drive to hang on myself. Thanks for that.;723;52;44;250;Very Positive

"Having electrolytes while fasting should curb headaches while fasting, for anyone interested.

A bit of sea salt in your water, maybe a small splash of unfiltered apple cider vinegar (with the mother), some liquid keto sweetener, and lemon/cucumber slices will help.  Or 0-5 calorie electrolyte mixes in some water works too.";145;53;46;325;Positive
