That instant regret moment was pure gold. And can we talk about Harry's commitment to honesty? Asking Jimmy to check even when they didn't notice, and still pulling off the win!  Respect. Also, Chunkz tricking Speed for that 10K had me in stitches! The Sidemen never fail to bring the entertainment. ;747;53;47;300;Very Negative;2022
