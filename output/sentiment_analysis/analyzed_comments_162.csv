If you're wondering why the naval mines didn't do any damage - it'd be because naval mines are meant to *run into the boat*, not to be blown up around it. That is the purpose of the huge spikes around it - they're pressure points that will detonate the mines if *any pressure is applied at all*, which is why they were so devastating & why the blasts were directed upwards as said mines would usually be underwater rather than on the surface.;2003;84;57;442;Negative
