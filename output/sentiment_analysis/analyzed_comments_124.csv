1:20 Actually, rationing water is a terrible idea in a survival situation but it's okay to ration food. The human body isn't designed to ration water and you're better off just drinking when you're thirsty and figuring out a plan after running out of water. Humans are also terrible at telling how close they are to death when dehydrated.;101;64;50;338;Negative
