Sorry for the long time with no videos! I tried spending 50 hours stranded at sea and got super sick and canceled it. After that I tried to build the world’s largest Minecraft mansion (spent like $300,000 lol) and it rained and fell. After that I filmed a different video that just wasn’t innovative enough so I deleted the final video. Whoops haha;172070;66;52;348;Very Negative;2021
