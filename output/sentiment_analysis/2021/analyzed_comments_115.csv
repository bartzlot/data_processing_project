Gotta love the fact that no scene is prolonged for the sake of lengthier videos. No building up tension, flashbacks, showing contestants silent reactions or other fuckery, just straight to action and here is the end. This same contest on TV would have been three, half hour episodes;445;48;44;282;Very Positive;2021

I love how Mark Rober who is a literal physicist, just completely missed the target after explaining what he was doing . He had better accuracy with an actual mars rover than a doll of himself. LMAO;454;36;34;198;Very Positive;2021

Hope you win!";2589;20;20;98;Very Positive;2021
Zach putting the camera in the toilet, running out of the bathroom, then back in just to get the shot and still winning the game was the most impressive thing i’ve ever seen.;283;34;28;174;Very Positive;2021
As a fellow engineer, I knew mark was gonna miss the doll target. We overthink everything in the moment. Give him a few days and he’d dial in those shots to 6sigma reliability.;809;34;31;176;Positive;2021
Bella has really perfected her ability of being able to do absolutely nothing and gain from it;111;17;17;94;Very Positive;2021
