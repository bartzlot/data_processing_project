WATCH UNTIL THE END BECAUSE ITS A CRAZY TWIST LOL;140069;10;10;49;Positive;2021
Thank you jimmy for never disappointing us with your content.;61810;10;10;61;Very Positive;2021
larray really slept during a $1M game ;92363;7;7;38;Very Negative;2021
Of course MatPat gets caught while explaining his perfect hiding spot, lol;2226;12;12;74;Neutral;2021
Real shouout to MatPat just handing out some terror to every hider he was near. Calling things out & being pretty much spot on.;49181;23;21;127;Very Positive;2021
MrBeast really is the only dude who could make each of his videos somehow a larger scale than the next;16950;20;19;102;Very Positive;2021
"Mrbeast is the definition of ""you're crazy until you succeed, then you're a genius""";14372;16;13;83;Very Positive;2021
MatPat was probably the deadliest seeker in his childhood;316;9;9;57;Very Negative;2021
I love how MatPat had a character arc. Originally, he got caught for overexplaining. Then, he nearly found two contestants, but missed them because of his overexplaining. Finally, he uses his overexplaining to find Zach, but due to the DQ, Zach wins anyway, bringing the arc full circle.;9909;48;38;287;Positive;2021
I was rooting for Zach and Mark. And yes Zach;3301;10;8;45;Very Positive;2021
Mat's inability to find actual people but know where they're hiding both impresses and scares me.;10801;18;18;97;Positive;2021
9:36 I love you can even see Larray outside the play area before the reveal.;33;16;15;76;Very Positive;2021
There’s something so full circle about MatPat being found whilst explaining why his hiding spot is so good Instead of getting into the hiding spot;9104;26;23;146;Neutral;2021
Can we appreciate how good Zach is in these challenges?;7251;10;10;55;Positive;2021
"Yes... 
I was rooting for Zach the entire time";4749;9;9;46;Very Positive;2021
7:35 Larry’s face is wild ;18;7;7;26;Very Positive;2021
Mr. Beast delivering better content than most of network television again...;7266;11;11;76;Very Positive;2021
"Matpat as a seeker is terrifying.
Bro is out here calculating everything";2750;12;11;72;Very Positive;2021
Matpat losing first hurt my heart;101;6;6;33;Very Negative;2021
Love how Zachary was one of the only ones giving it his all, and he ended up winning. Well deserved mate;2804;21;21;104;Very Positive;2021
MatPat is a terrifying seeker, even if he doesn't actually find you, just hearing him examine and explain hiding spots in depth would be heart racing and could cause people to slip up and reveal themselves or maybe make it so they try to move spot and end up running into another seeker.;3320;54;48;287;Positive;2021
Thanks MatPat for everything! <3;278;5;5;32;Very Positive;2021
Matpat true to himself, overthinks his hiding spot and gets caught in the open. Classic;4256;15;15;87;Very Positive;2021
I love how Matpat is always right about where everyone’s hiding but does nothing about it;2392;17;16;89;Neutral;2021
I love MatPat got out because he was explaining to the camera why he was hiding where he was. He can't stop explaining things!!!;2476;25;19;128;Very Positive;2021
"Dude when there's a theorist on the opposite team.
You know you ain't winning";12;16;15;77;Very Negative;2021
Damn, that ending was a twist.;4788;6;6;30;Negative;2021
I am genuinely happy for Zach. Arguably the most creative content creator in this lineup.. ;5065;15;15;91;Very Positive;2021
Matpat comedy cost him 1M. That's the most expensive joke ever;8538;12;12;62;Very Negative;2021
2:37 I love how Ryan tries to fit in with the group but then just decides to walk behind.;7;20;19;89;Negative;2021
Only Zach could magic himself a win out of a loss. Well done. MatPat was absurdly accurate with what he called out.;1709;22;20;115;Positive;2021
Zach totally deserves it considering how much work the man puts in. Great job Zach!!;503;15;14;84;Very Positive;2021
Matpat finding people by his intelligence but also getting caught due to it is the most ironic thing I have watched this year ;1553;23;23;126;Positive;2021
Justice for ro and quackity. They outlasted Logan and larray and Zach king cheated by going in the ceiling.;109;19;17;107;Very Negative;2021
MatPat is Literally the Embodiment of a Hunter.;769;8;8;47;Very Positive;2021
I was rooting for him the entire time! I'm glad he won! Also, MatPat is pretty terrifying to play against.;975;21;20;106;Very Positive;2021
Larray falling asleep has to be the most relatable thing ever =]];7975;11;11;65;Very Positive;2021
Release all 26 hours light edits! Let’s see how it rlly went down!!;47;14;14;67;Very Negative;2021
MatPat was the highlight of the episode ;6333;7;6;40;Positive;2021
Only Zach could magic himself a win out of a loss. Well done.;1612;13;12;61;Positive;2021
Props to Mat for explaining the best hiding spot instead of hiding right away;1277;14;13;77;Positive;2021
man Zach king winning is the best person to win. He will definitely use the money to give back!;9;19;17;95;Very Positive;2021
Matpat literally sniff out his prey spot on and made the hiders terrified;720;13;13;73;Very Positive;2021
Man, MatPat was so good at knowing where people were hiding, he just missed out barely on two people;1017;19;18;100;Neutral;2021
sofie can fit in anything she’s got an advantage;2;10;10;48;Very Positive;2021
Matpat did exactly what he does in his channel, getting extremely close to what he is looking, closer than anyone who is trying the same thing, but screwing it up at the end;1326;33;29;173;Positive;2021
Mat’s pure confidence kills me each time I see him SO CLOSE to finding another person;848;17;17;85;Very Positive;2021
Matpat is the best at finding people without  finding them;869;10;9;58;Very Positive;2021
and thus a villan arc was started when this vid came out.;2;12;12;57;Negative;2021
It's a tradition to watch this once in a while.;28;11;10;47;Positive;2021
"it's hilarious how MatPat got close to a ton of people but couldn't find them.

besides zach.";3576;19;19;93;Positive;2021
Mark's plan was literally so smart, he could've gotten away with it if the worker went in laps around the building instead of staying in one spot.;1988;29;27;146;Negative;2021
Mat pat is terrifying, he can analyse just about everything so deeply;4620;12;12;69;Very Positive;2021
Rewatching this and seeing matpat now hurts;5;7;7;43;Very Positive;2021
"Matpat: First out due to over explaining 
Also Him: misses two people due to over explaining 
Also Also him: The one time over explaining works to his advantage to find a guy, he wins on a technicality";3752;37;25;201;Neutral;2021
Matpat finding people by his intelligence but also getting caught due to it is the most ironic thing i have watched this year.;1396;23;23;126;Positive;2021
Let’s get Mr. Beast to be the biggest YouTuber in the history of the world! This guy is amazing!;2259;20;18;96;Very Positive;2021
You should be proud of yourself ro.;16;7;7;35;Very Positive;2021
The fact that MatPat perfectly found three hiders after being the first one out and failed to get a single one out is amazing to me.;2750;26;22;132;Very Positive;2021
I just love that MatPat got out because he was explaining to the camera why he was hiding where he was. He can’t stop explaining things!;1727;27;21;136;Very Positive;2021
5:45 Imagine if he came back and knocked the door?! , Paul would shat his pants.;3;16;16;80;Very Negative;2021
Crazy to see how much editing was put into this. I just finished listening to Mat talk about the shoot for this, he wasn't even found until about 2 hours in after Jimmy told them to move spots;842;39;35;192;Very Negative;2021
MatPat coming so close and missing the hiders everytime is hilarious.;4922;11;11;69;Very Positive;2021
The amount of patience Jimmy demonstrates in these videos has always fascinated me.;218;13;13;83;Very Positive;2021
Who's here after MatPat's final theory? and meets Scott himself? hits different ;3;14;13;80;Neutral;2021
Mark had the best hiding spot! Too bad the NPC employee was glitching and gave him up;5374;17;16;85;Very Negative;2021
The fact that Matpat was overthinking his hiding spot was just legendary he was so confident! I wished he would’ve won but the winner deserves it!;1167;27;23;146;Very Positive;2021
MatPat was absurdly accurate with what he called out;2047;9;9;52;Very Negative;2021

That $1 million dollar nap man.;4434;6;6;31;Very Negative;2021
Matpat was showing so much intelligence when he was finding people but while he was hiding he was explaining to us and got caught. The real Hunter sacrificed himself for the audience;2070;32;26;182;Very Negative;2021
Jimmy's videos are incredibly entertaining and they never disappoint!!!;10;10;10;71;Very Positive;2021

Mat being a seeker and using all of his theory skills to look for hiding spots and clues makes me incredibly happy;711;22;21;114;Very Positive;2021
MatPat was entertaining the entire video lol;1;7;7;44;Positive;2021
Marks hiding spot was actually the best. The worker was just a little too suspicious . Congratulations Zach ;647;17;15;108;Positive;2021
I love how MatPat’s just right all the time about where everyone’s hiding but doesn’t do anything about it.;2413;22;20;107;Positive;2021

probably the most deserving winner in terms of content creator skill, zachs a legend in this industry i have no doubt the money will be well spent;963;27;25;146;Very Positive;2021
So could this mean that MatPat manage to capture/seek Logan? WHOAAAAAAAAA~;18;12;12;74;Negative;2021
Can we just appreciate how MatPat kept coming so close to finding someone yet kept overthinking it?;4584;17;16;99;Neutral;2021
