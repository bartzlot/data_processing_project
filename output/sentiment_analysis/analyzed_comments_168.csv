here's a tip to fall asleep a little faster: take 3 fingers, put them on the bottom of your palm horizontally, then put a finger to the point on the bottom of those 3 fingers and massage this area, it is a pressure point meaning it will soothe your nerves and therefore you fall asleep faster, hope this helped :);129;60;40;313;Very Positive
