I keep seeing all these videos where you help people who couldn't afford some things on their own. Being someone who has successfully made it out of a life of drug addiction and homelessness I too try my best to help others I see in a hopeless situation with whatever I can spare while letting them know that if I was able to make it out then I KNOW they can.
