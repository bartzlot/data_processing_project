"Nice. Slab City is an interesting place. Yes, it is a community where people respect each other and get to meet really colorful people.
Salvation Mountain is being maintained and restored by the near by community and good samaritans from out of the area. The hill was first inhabited and build by one person, Leonard Knight. Every day he would dedicate his time, resources and passion and his whole life to the project.
He was very welcoming and was all than more than happy to welcome people that came by to take a look and told them bout his life and the reason for the hill. 
It's a place he spent to worship and wanted to people to know about and get people to come, has his way to spread the word of the lord. All the things you see he made by hand, painted it all, built it all with mud and hay, the large branches he moved all himself.
He passed away in 2014.";332;167;103;866;Positive;2019
