Grizz wasn't manipulating him, he was helping him make the best decision of his life. That kind of money will absolutely change his families lives forever. It gets hard being separated from family, so much so that it takes a toll on one psychologically and makes them not see things clearly.;7130;52;46;291;Negative
That Grizz guy is so refreshing. Able to confront, forgive, understand, share his opinion. Healthy communicator.;436;16;16;112;Very Positive
