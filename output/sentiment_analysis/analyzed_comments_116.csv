WATCH UNTIL THE END BECAUSE ITS A CRAZY TWIST LOL;140069;10;10;49;Positive
Thank you jimmy for never disappointing us with your content.;61810;10;10;61;Very Positive
larray really slept during a $1M game ;92363;7;7;38;Very Negative
Of course MatPat gets caught while explaining his perfect hiding spot, lol;2226;12;12;74;Neutral
Real shouout to MatPat just handing out some terror to every hider he was near. Calling things out & being pretty much spot on.;49181;23;21;127;Very Positive
MrBeast really is the only dude who could make each of his videos somehow a larger scale than the next;16950;20;19;102;Very Positive
"Mrbeast is the definition of ""you're crazy until you succeed, then you're a genius""";14372;16;13;83;Very Positive
MatPat was probably the deadliest seeker in his childhood;316;9;9;57;Very Negative
I love how MatPat had a character arc. Originally, he got caught for overexplaining. Then, he nearly found two contestants, but missed them because of his overexplaining. Finally, he uses his overexplaining to find Zach, but due to the DQ, Zach wins anyway, bringing the arc full circle.;9909;48;38;287;Positive
I was rooting for Zach and Mark. And yes Zach;3301;10;8;45;Very Positive
Mat's inability to find actual people but know where they're hiding both impresses and scares me.;10801;18;18;97;Positive
9:36 I love you can even see Larray outside the play area before the reveal.;33;16;15;76;Very Positive
There’s something so full circle about MatPat being found whilst explaining why his hiding spot is so good Instead of getting into the hiding spot;9104;26;23;146;Neutral
Can we appreciate how good Zach is in these challenges?;7251;10;10;55;Positive
"Yes... 
I was rooting for Zach the entire time";4749;9;9;46;Very Positive

Bro is out here calculating everything";2750;12;11;72;Very Positive
Matpat losing first hurt my heart;101;6;6;33;Very Negative
Love how Zachary was one of the only ones giving it his all, and he ended up winning. Well deserved mate;2804;21;21;104;Very Positive
MatPat is a terrifying seeker, even if he doesn't actually find you, just hearing him examine and explain hiding spots in depth would be heart racing and could cause people to slip up and reveal themselves or maybe make it so they try to move spot and end up running into another seeker.;3320;54;48;287;Positive
Thanks MatPat for everything! <3;278;5;5;32;Very Positive
Matpat true to himself, overthinks his hiding spot and gets caught in the open. Classic;4256;15;15;87;Very Positive
I love how Matpat is always right about where everyone’s hiding but does nothing about it;2392;17;16;89;Neutral
I love MatPat got out because he was explaining to the camera why he was hiding where he was. He can't stop explaining things!!!;2476;25;19;128;Very Positive
"Dude when there's a theorist on the opposite team.
You know you ain't winning";12;16;15;77;Very Negative
Damn, that ending was a twist.;4788;6;6;30;Negative
I am genuinely happy for Zach. Arguably the most creative content creator in this lineup.. ;5065;15;15;91;Very Positive
Matpat comedy cost him 1M. That's the most expensive joke ever;8538;12;12;62;Very Negative
2:37 I love how Ryan tries to fit in with the group but then just decides to walk behind.;7;20;19;89;Negative
Only Zach could magic himself a win out of a loss. Well done. MatPat was absurdly accurate with what he called out.;1709;22;20;115;Positive
Zach totally deserves it considering how much work the man puts in. Great job Zach!!;503;15;14;84;Very Positive
Matpat finding people by his intelligence but also getting caught due to it is the most ironic thing I have watched this year ;1553;23;23;126;Positive
Justice for ro and quackity. They outlasted Logan and larray and Zach king cheated by going in the ceiling.;109;19;17;107;Very Negative

sofie can fit in anything she’s got an advantage;2;10;10;48;Very Positive
Matpat did exactly what he does in his channel, getting extremely close to what he is looking, closer than anyone who is trying the same thing, but screwing it up at the end;1326;33;29;173;Positive
Mat’s pure confidence kills me each time I see him SO CLOSE to finding another person;848;17;17;85;Very Positive
Matpat is the best at finding people without  finding them;869;10;9;58;Very Positive
and thus a villan arc was started when this vid came out.;2;12;12;57;Negative
It's a tradition to watch this once in a while.;28;11;10;47;Positive
"it's hilarious how MatPat got close to a ton of people but couldn't find them.

Mark's plan was literally so smart, he could've gotten away with it if the worker went in laps around the building instead of staying in one spot.;1988;29;27;146;Negative
Mat pat is terrifying, he can analyse just about everything so deeply;4620;12;12;69;Very Positive

I just love that MatPat got out because he was explaining to the camera why he was hiding where he was. He can’t stop explaining things!;1727;27;21;136;Very Positive
5:45 Imagine if he came back and knocked the door?! , Paul would shat his pants.;3;16;16;80;Very Negative
Crazy to see how much editing was put into this. I just finished listening to Mat talk about the shoot for this, he wasn't even found until about 2 hours in after Jimmy told them to move spots;842;39;35;192;Very Negative
MatPat coming so close and missing the hiders everytime is hilarious.;4922;11;11;69;Very Positive

MatPat was entertaining the entire video lol;1;7;7;44;Positive
Marks hiding spot was actually the best. The worker was just a little too suspicious . Congratulations Zach ;647;17;15;108;Positive
I love how MatPat’s just right all the time about where everyone’s hiding but doesn’t do anything about it.;2413;22;20;107;Positive
