You gotta respect this man. He randomly donates to people and charities and he puts himself through suffering just for our entertainment.;7905;22;20;137;Very Positive
The “I wanna see the sun” and then the “oh” when it was completely dark out. CRACKED me up ;354;19;17;91;Very Negative
It’s honestly really cool how the guys let him out as soft as they did. You can tell Jimmy was feeling the best he could’ve once those doors opened and his friends hugged him;6628;36;33;174;Very Positive

Одно из самых прикольных это то, что он попытался сделать стойку на руках! Великолепная идея! А ещё я думаю, что хорошо было бы делать зарядку для тела - упражнения какие-то для поддержания тонуса, для растяжки. Помимо того, что это суровое испытание, физическая активность кажется полезным занятием.;8;46;40;300;Very Positive
It's incredible to think that despite being locked up for days with no interaction at all, Jimmy still managed to promote his sponsor on day 5. True dedication!;917;29;28;160;Very Positive
