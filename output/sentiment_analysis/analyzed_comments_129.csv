Being from a poor country, and with a very low economic situation, it gives me great joy to see how MrBest changes the lives of people who may have the same deficiencies as me... sometimes he asked me if he came to my country Venezuela. Surely I would win any challenge that I propose! If with that I finally manage to have my own home and finish my studies, I would be the first in my country to do so... great MrBeast! for making a difference!;300;86;61;445;Very Positive
